          <p>
            Welcome to the Brisbane Buzzwoles Sunday Tournaments page! This page is 
            the home for all competitive Pokemon Video Game Championships tournaments 
            hosted by us in Queensland, Australia. For the time being, we are unable
            to host officially sanctioned Play! Pokemon events however we are still able
            to host unofficial local tournaments for fun!
          </p>

          <p>
            All of our tournaments will be held in the best-of-three format, in the 
            most recent official Pokemon VGC format unless otherwise specified. These
            tournaments are mostly held just for fun and practise, however prizes may
            be offered for winners or random participants on the day. However, season 
            points will be awarded to all competitors depending on placement and these
            will remain until the end of the season. The points breakdown can be seen below.

            The points are mostly arbitrary, and really just for bragging rights. At 
            the conclusion of the season the competitor in first place will be crowned 
            the season champion! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to

              <h4>
                Best of Three
              </h4>
              <p>
                In a best-of-three tournament, players play a maximum of three 
                games, or until one player has won two games. As opposed to a 
                best of one tournament, where only one match is played each
                round to decide the winner.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Swiss Rounds
              </h4>
              <p>
                In the swiss rounds of a tournament, you are paired up against a random
                opponent with the same (or as close as possible) win-loss record as you. 
                You are not eliminated from the tournament if you lose multiple times, 
                and can keep playing until the end of the tournament regardless of 
                your win-loss record. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Top Cut
              </h4>
              <p>
                For a tournament that has a top cut, the top-x players in the tournament
                (usually the top 4 or the top 8, depending on player count) make it into
                the top cut bracket. Those players then enter into a single elimination 
                (one loss and you are out) bracket until a winner is decided.
