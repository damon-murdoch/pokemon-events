          <p>
            Welcome to the Brisbane Buzzwoles Sunday Tournaments page! This page is 
            the home for all competitive Pokemon Video Game Championships tournaments 
            hosted by us in Queensland, Australia. For the time being, we are unable
            to host officially sanctioned Play! Pokemon events however we are still able
            to host unofficial local tournaments for fun!
          </p>

          <p>
            <b> Team sheet submissions are required </b> for our tournaments, however they do
            not need to be provided physically. To submit a digital team sheet, please send 
            an email to 
            <a class='link-light' href='mailto:scrubbs.pokemon@gmail.com'>
              scrubbs.pokemon@gmail.com
            </a>
            with a completed team sheet pdf file attached. Please ensure the subject of your email 
            matches the following format: 

            <p>
              <samp>
                Team Submission - (Date of Tournament) - (Your Name)'
              </samp>
            </p>

            <p>
              e.g.
            </p>

            <p>
              <samp>
                Team Submission - 27/03/2022 - Damon Murdoch.
              </samp>
            </p>

            This will help me keep track of them if they are needed for team checks. 
            If you have not submitted a digital team sheet, you will be required to submit 
            a physical team sheet on the day. For more information, please see the definitions 
            section for teamsheets below. 
            <b>
              Please note that digital team sheets are not allowed for official, sanctioned 
              tournaments and are only permissible for our grassroots events.
            </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            All of our tournaments will be held in the best-of-three format, in the 
            most recent official Pokemon VGC format unless otherwise specified. Please 
            These tournaments are mostly held just for fun and practise, however prizes 
            may be offered for winners or random participants on the day. However, season 
            points will be awarded to all competitors depending on placement and these
            will remain until the end of the season. The points breakdown can be seen below.

            The points are mostly arbitrary, and really just for bragging rights. At 
            the conclusion of the season the competitor in first place will be crowned 
            the season champion! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to

          <p>
            Here are some commonly-used tournament terms which may
            be confusing for newer players and / or parents. Please
            feel free to contact me with any other questions you might
            have or anything you think needs to be clarified!
          <p>

              <h4>
                Best of Three
              </h4>
              <p>
                In a best-of-three tournament, players play a maximum of three 
                games, or until one player has won two games. As opposed to a 
                best of one tournament, where only one match is played each
                round to decide the winner.

                Swiss Rounds
              </h4>
              <p>
                In the swiss rounds of a tournament, you are paired up against a random
                opponent with the same (or as close as possible) win-loss record as you. 
                You are not eliminated from the tournament if you lose multiple times, 
                and can keep playing until the end of the tournament regardless of 
                your win-loss record. 
              </p>

              <h4>
                Teamsheet
              </h4>
              <p>
                A teamsheet is an official document which records all of the significant information
                about the team you submit for a tournament. For example, the species, items, abilities, 
                etc. for all of your pokemon. For all official Play! Pokemon events, a teamsheet is 
                required to be submitted before round one of the tournament. For some larger events, 
                teamsheets may be submitted online through the official rk9labs platform however for 
                smaller events you will almost always need to fill out a physical teamsheet. Teamsheets
                are required to ensure players are using legal teams, and that players are not changing
                teams (or items / moves / etc.) throughout the day. The official Pokemon team sheet
                template can be found 
                <a class='link-light' href='https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/pdf/play-pokemon/rules/play-pokemon-vg-team-list-2020.pdf'>
                  here
                </a>
                . Otherwise, you can use the (unofficial) automatic team sheet filler 
                <a class="link-light" href="http://www.dragapult.xyz/teamsheet-filler/">
                  here.

            <li>
              <h4>
                Top Cut
              </h4>
              <p>
                For a tournament that has a top cut, the top-x players in the tournament
                (usually the top 4 or the top 8, depending on player count) make it into
                the top cut bracket. Those players then enter into a single elimination 
                (one loss and you are out) bracket until a winner is decided.
